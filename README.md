# Wildfire Detection using Remote Sensing & Machine Learning

## Problem Statement

Wildfires cause significant environmental and economic damage worldwide.  
Accurate and fast detection of burned areas is critical for disaster response and ecological assessment.

Traditional methods are time-consuming and not scalable.  
This project aims to automate burned area detection using satellite imagery and machine learning.

## Project Description
This project focuses on detecting wildfire-affected areas using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and machine learning models in Google Earth Engine.

The system analyzes post-fire satellite data to classify burned areas and evaluate model performance.

## Case Study: Manavgat Wildfire (2021)

This project demonstrates the methodology using the Manavgat wildfire event in Turkey.  
However, the pipeline is designed to be adaptable to different geographic regions and wildfire events.

## Technologies Used
- Google Earth Engine (GEE)
- JavaScript
- Sentinel-2 Satellite Data
- Machine Learning:
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

## How It Works

1. Satellite imagery is filtered (low cloud coverage)
2. Training data is labeled:
   - Burned areas
   - Healthy vegetation
   - Water (for improved classification)
3. Models are trained and evaluated
4. Burned areas are classified and visualized
5. Total burned area is calculated (hectares)

## Model Comparison (Random Forest vs SVM)

### Results:

- Random Forest Accuracy: **0.9757**  
- SVM Accuracy: **0.9079**  

- RF Burned Area: **35,794 ha**  
- SVM Burned Area: **53,060 ha**  
- Difference: **17,265 ha**

### Key Insight:
Random Forest produces more reliable and stable results, while SVM tends to overestimate burned areas.

## Error Analysis (Impact of Water Class)

### Results:

- SVM V1 Accuracy: **0.9925**  
- SVM V2 Accuracy: **0.9967**

### Confusion Matrix:

**V1 (Without Water Class):**
[[1063,19],
[20,4140]]

**V2 (With Water Class):**
[[992,47,0],
[65,4182,0],
[0,0,29650]]

### Key Insight:
Including water as a separate class significantly reduces misclassification and improves model robustness.
